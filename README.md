# Chatbot with Chainlit and RAG techniques

## Overview

This project utilizes Chainlit, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and Large Language Models (LLMs) to build a chatbot capable of answering questions based on the content of uploaded PDF documents. By integrating RAG, the chatbot enhances the quality of generated responses by retrieving relevant content from the provided documents.

### Key Features

- **Document Upload**: Users can upload PDF or text files.
- **Question Answering**: Users can ask questions related to the content of the uploaded documents.
- **Enhanced Responses**: The system retrieves relevant content from documents to improve response accuracy.

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/huytranhk13cqt/RAG_QA_PDF.git
   cd RAG_QA_PDF
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.8 or above. Install the necessary packages using pip:
   ```sh
   pip install transformers==4.41.2 bitsandbytes==0.43.1 accelerate==0.31.0 langchain==0.2.5 langchainhub==0.1.20 langchain-chroma==0.1.1 langchain-community==0.2.5 langchain-huggingface==0.0.3 python-dotenv==1.0.1 pypdf==4.2.0 numpy==1.24.4 chainlit==1.1.304
   ```

## Usage
